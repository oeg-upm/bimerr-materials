## BIMERR MATERIALS FILES

In [this folder](./Examples) we can see an example of an [idf file](./Examples/ASHRAE_2005_HOF_Materials.idf), which has been transformed into a [json file](./Examples/ASHRAE_2005_HOF_Materials.json), with which the corresponding [RDF files](./RDF_Examples/ASHRAE_2005_HOF_Materials.ttl) have been obtained by means of declarative mappings. These files contain information about materials that have been used in constructions and buildings.

## CODE IMPLEMENTATION

The implementation of the code has been carried out using the [Python language](https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0/). Also, we have used [Helio](https://oeg-upm.github.io/helio/)) to achieve the transformation of the data by means of mappings to RDF format.
